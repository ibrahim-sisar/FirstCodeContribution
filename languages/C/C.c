#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 45, 3, 67, 23};
    // call your function
}

/*
 You need to write a function that takes an array as input and returns the largest number in that array.
 Above your function, write a comment with your name and GitHub link.
 Name your function after your name, considering case sensitivity in the programming language.
Call your function inside the pre-existing main() function (which is already written in the file).
